# DAILY CHALLENGES

This is where I will be completing daily challenges using javascript. If you are interested, I have started investing in learning Swift 5. That is a separate profile due to needing a MAC computer. iOS-mikedilulo is where you can find daily challenges in Edabit and Repl.it for Swift.
